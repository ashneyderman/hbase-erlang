Diver
=====

A HBase driver for Erlang/Elixir using [jinterface](http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/jinterface/jinterface_users_guide.html) and the [Asynchbase Java client](https://github.com/OpenTSDB/asynchbase) to query the database.

This work is inspired by the [`lucene_server`](https://github.com/inaka/lucene_server) and [`yokozuna`](https://github.com/basho/yokozuna) projects.

Diver was created and is maintained by Chris Molozian (@novabyte) and contributors.
